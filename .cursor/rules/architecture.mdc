The architecture follows Clean Architecture principles with dependency injection via tsyringe.

UI components are placed in the @ui package.

Components contain no business logic, only visual representation and event forwarding.

All types, DTOs, and API clients are placed in the @api package.

External API calls (e.g. to the processing center) are handled in @api.
